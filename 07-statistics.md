## <a name="section-a"></a>1.  Introduction

[<img src="img/think_stats.jpg" title="Think Stats"/>](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)

Use Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) book for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. This book is available online, or you can buy a paper copy if you would like.

Use this book as a reference when answering the 6 required statistics questions below.  The Think Stats book is approximately 200 pages in length.  **It is recommended that you read the entire book, particularly if you are less familiar with introductory statistical concepts.**

Complete the following exercises along with the questions in this file. Some can be solved using code provided with the book. The preface of Think Stats [explains](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2001.html#toc2) how to use the code.  

Communicate the problem, how you solved it, and the solution, within each of the following [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files. (You can include code blocks and images within markdown.)

## <a name="section-b"></a>2.  Why We Are Using Think Stats 

The stats exercises have been chosen to introduce/solidify some relevant statistical concepts related to data science.  The solutions for these exercises are available in the [ThinkStats repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2).  You should focus on understanding the statistical concepts, python programming and interpreting the results.  If you are stuck, review the solutions and recode the python in a way that is more understandable to you. 

For example, in the first exercise, the author has already written a function to compute Cohen's D.  **You could import it, or you could write your own code to practice python and develop a deeper understanding of the concept.** 

Think Stats uses a higher degree of python complexity from the python tutorials and introductions to python concepts, and that is intentional to prepare you for the bootcamp.  

**One of the skills to learn here is to understand other people’s code.  And this author is quite experienced, so it’s good to learn how functions and imports work.**

## <a name="section-d"></a>4.  Required Exercises

*Include your Python code, results and explanation (where applicable).*

### Q1. [Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](statistics/2-4-cohens_d.md) (effect size of Cohen's d)  
Cohen's D is an example of effect size.  Other examples of effect size are:  correlation between two variables, mean difference, regression coefficients and standardized test statistics such as: t, Z, F, etc. In this example, you will compute Cohen's D to quantify (or measure) the difference between two groups of data.   

You will see effect size again and again in results of algorithms that are run in data science.  For instance, in the bootcamp, when you run a regression analysis, you will recognize the t-statistic as an example of effect size.

#### Answer 2.4:
The basic premise of this problem was to isolate the first born children from 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. By assigning those to variables, we can reference first borns and others separately to compare their attributes. Then, using a function that calculates Cohen's Effect Size, we inputed the the variables.

Here is the code:
```
import math
preg = ReadFemPreg()
preg = CleanFemPreg(preg)

Def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2)
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()
    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)

    pooled_var = (n1*var1 + n2*var2)/(n1 + n2)
    d = diff/math.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return d

live = preg[preg.outcome == 1]
firsts = live[live.birthord == 1]
others = live[live.birthord != 1]

d_weight = CohenEffectSize(firsts["totalwgt_lb"], others["totalwgt_lb])
d_preglength = CohenEffectSize(firsts["prglngth"], others["prglngth"])
```
The first calculation was to determine the Effect Size between birth weight of first babies vs.birth weight of later babies. This was calculated to be -0.0897.

The second calculation was to determine the Effect Size between pregnancy length of first babies vs. pregnancy length of later babies. This was calculated to be 0.0289.

These results tell us that first children generally weigh slightly less than their younger siblings at birth, and later pregnancies tend to last slightly longer than pregnancies of first born children. However, these effect sizes are very very small, so the data indicates that the difference is quite minimal.

### Q2. [Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](statistics/3-1-actual_biased.md) (actual vs. biased)
This problem presents a robust example of actual vs biased data.  As a data scientist, it will be important to examine not only the data that is available, but also the data that may be missing but highly relevant.  You will see how the absence of this relevant data will bias a dataset, its distribution, and ultimately, its statistical interpretation.

#### Answer 3.1:
In this problem, I used the variable numkdhss on the nsfg response data to generate a list of the number of children per family. I created a dictionary to store this information, for easy input to the pmf and biased pmf function. I then calculated the pmf and biased pmf using functions found in chapter three, and plotted the data.

Here is the code:
```
from __future__ import print_function

import math
import numpy as np

import nsfg
import first
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

resp = nsfg.ReadFemResp()
kk = resp.numkdhh

def householdkids(d):
    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(d, label="actual")
    print("actual mean: ", pmf.Mean())
    biased_pmf = BiasPmf(pmf, label="observed")
    print("observed mean: ", biased_pmf.Mean())
    
def PlotPmfs(d):
    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(d, label="actual")
    biased_pmf = BiasPmf(pmf, label="observed")
    
    thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
    thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf, biased_pmf])
    thinkplot.Show(root = "Kids in Family", xlabel = "Number of kids", ylabel = "PMF", axis = [0,5,0,0.5])

def BiasPmf(pmf, label=''):
    new_pmf = pmf.Copy(label=label)

    for x, p in pmf.Items():
        new_pmf.Mult(x, x)
        
    new_pmf.Normalize()
    return new_pmf
  
    
housekids = {}
for i in range(len(kk)):
    if kk[i] in housekids:
        housekids[kk[i]] = (housekids[kk[i]])+1
    else:
        housekids[kk[i]] = 1
    


householdkids(housekids)
PlotPmfs(housekids)
```

In this data, the actual mean is 1.024, and the observed mean is 2.403.

### Q3. [Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](statistics/4-2-random_dist.md) (random distribution)  
This questions asks you to examine the function that produces random numbers.  Is it really random?  A good way to test that is to examine the pmf and cdf of the list of random numbers and visualize the distribution.  If you're not sure what pmf is, read more about it in Chapter 3.  

### Q4. [Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](statistics/5-1-blue_men.md) (normal distribution of blue men)
This is a classic example of hypothesis testing using the normal distribution.  The effect size used here is the Z-statistic. 



### Q5. Bayesian (Elvis Presley twin) 

Bayes' Theorem is an important tool in understanding what we really know, given evidence of other information we have, in a quantitative way.  It helps incorporate conditional probabilities into our conclusions.

Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth.  What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin? Assume we observe the following probabilities in the population: fraternal twin is 1/125 and identical twin is 1/300.

## <a name="section-e"></a>5.  Optional Exercises

The following exercises are optional, but we highly encourage you to complete them if you have the time.

### Q7. [Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](statistics/7-1-weight_vs_age.md) (correlation of weight vs. age)
In this exercise, you will compute the effect size of correlation.  Correlation measures the relationship of two variables, and data science is about exploring relationships in data.    

### Q8. [Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](statistics/8-2-sampling_dist.md) (sampling distribution)
In the theoretical world, all data related to an experiment or a scientific problem would be available.  In the real world, some subset of that data is available.  This exercise asks you to take samples from an exponential distribution and examine how the standard error and confidence intervals vary with the sample size.

### Q9. [Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](statistics/6-1-household_income.md) (skewness of household income)
### Q10. [Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 3](statistics/8-3-scoring.md) (scoring)
### Q11. [Think Stats Chapter 9 Exercise 2](statistics/9-2-resampling.md) (resampling)
